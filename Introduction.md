# Introduction #

We propose to offer a java implementation of 2D images matching algorithm based on phase correlation.


# Details #
Inspired by http://lecturer.eepis-its.edu/~dhoto/publikasi/ucc/e87-a_3_682.pdf, we propose an implementation in Java of 2D matching algorithm.
The **goal**, allow to match 2 images (one reference against one candidate) and return a score corresponding to probability that both images represent same things. These implementation could be apply to:
**_biometrics_ matching as fingerprint, iris, face** _astronomy_ matching
